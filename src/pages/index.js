    <h1>Our philosophy</h1>
    <div className="sect">
      Research states 90% of the brain develops by the age of 5 years and a child shapes
      his or her beliefs, values and life in these primitive years. At Gems ’n’ Pearls preschool, we provide a
      safe, nurturing and stimulating environment for all children. We believe in allowing children to
      express themselves through language, art, creativity and physical activity, by providing an
      environment that is challenging and fun. We trust experiential learning is deemed to empower
      children and hence facilitating an environment that welcomes every child into its system and allows
      them to explore, have fun and learn or imbibe life skills is our philosophy.
